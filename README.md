<h2>PROTOTYPE: Smart Home App for Android</h2>

<h3>This is an example mobile app for a smart home, written in Kotlin as part of the Android Lab Course.</h3>
<h3>Example usages:</h3>

- Use HTTP requests to get current local and apparent temperatures from a REST endpoint, and display them on the device.
- Use the device's built-in brightness sensor to turn on a light if under a certain threshold.
- Use the device's camera to take a photo inside the app, then upload that photo to an external server using HTTP requests.
- Allow the user to set up and trigger their own presets, allowing them to turn on/off multiple lights at once.
- Allow the user to write their own NFC tags using the app, and turn on a specific light if that tag is put near the device.
- Allow the user to set up an own pass code used for authentication when launching the app.

<h3>!!! Please keep in mind that the REST endpoint for most functionalities is disabled by now !!!</h3>
